# Security Components Setup Guide

This guide helps you set up and troubleshoot security components in the Saleor e-commerce platform.

## Sentry SDK Installation

Sentry is used for error tracking and monitoring. If you're experiencing errors related to Sentry SDK imports, follow these steps to fix them:

1. Make sure you have installed all dependencies using Poetry:
   ```
   poetry install
   ```

2. If you continue to have issues with Sentry SDK, you can manually install it:
   ```
   poetry add sentry-sdk
   ```

3. Verify the installation:
   ```
   poetry show sentry-sdk
   ```

## Environment Configuration

Sentry integration requires configuration in your environment settings. Add the following to your `.env` file:

```
SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn  # Leave empty to disable Sentry
```

## Jaeger Tracing Installation

If you're experiencing errors with Jaeger Client imports, install it using:

```
poetry add jaeger-client
```

## Security Features

The security monitoring system provides:

1. Real-time security event monitoring
2. Security audit capabilities
3. Security log exports
4. Critical event alerts

To enable these features, make sure your database is properly migrated:

```
poetry run python manage.py migrate
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Import Errors

If you see import errors in the settings.py file, we've added graceful fallbacks that should prevent the application from crashing. The system will display warnings instead of failing when optional security components are not available.

### Permission Issues

If you encounter permission issues with security logs, ensure that:

1. Your application has write permissions to the security logs directory
2. The directory exists or can be created by the application

### Failed Security Audits

If security audits are failing, check that:

1. Your application has the correct settings in the Django settings file
2. You have proper HTTPS configurations if running in production
